* The Code converter is used to convert one type of binary code to another. 
* There are different types of binary codes like BCD code, gray code, excess-3 code, etc. 
* Different codes are used for different types of digital applications.
* So it is necessary to convert one code to another.
* A person can convert data to a desired format with the help of this project in timely manner. 
* Since, the digital logic circuitry requires numorous calculations of such type, it will be benificial to have such a system.
