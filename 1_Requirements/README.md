## Introduction: 

  In digital electronics, the number system is used for representing the information. The number system has different bases and the most common of them are the decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal. Any digital system can understand only the optional number system. In these systems, digits symbols are used to represent different values. The system introduced in the project makes it easier to convert a data from one representation method/ number system to other. A person can convert data to a desired format with the help of this project in timely manner. Since, the digital logic circuitry requires numorous calculations of such type, it will be benificial to have such a system. 


## Features:

This system supports following types of data conversions (For positive integers): 
* Decimal to Binary
* Decimal to HexaDecimal
* Decimal to Excess-3
* Decimal to BCD
* Decimal to Octal

# How to Convert Decimal to Binary?
To convert numbers from decimal to binary, the given decimal number is divided repeatedly by 2 and the remainders are noted down till we get 0 as the final quotient. The following steps is considered as the decimal to binary formula that shows the procedure of conversion.

* Step 1: Divide the given decimal number by 2 and note down the remainder.
* Step 2: Now, divide the obtained quotient by 2, and note the remainder again.
* Step 3: Repeat the above steps until you get 0 as the quotient.
* Step 4: Now, write the remainders in such a way that the last remainder is written first, followed by the rest in the reverse order.
* Step 5: This can also be understood in another way which states that the Least Significant Bit (LSB) of the binary number is at the top and the Most Significant Bit (MSB) is at the bottom. This number is the binary value of the given decimal number.
